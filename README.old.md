This is my own react project. I will utilize what I have learned from crush curses on practice.

My idea: Web-site with a bunch of tasks related to Naruto anime. 
    There must be navbar to naviagate between task pages, about page, and to show contact info
    Login, authorisation, log out
    Some taks:
        Guest character from picture
        Task from a character (Press on characters picture and then pop up window appears)
